### Configuration of Testing Framework:

- Utilizes Jest as the testing framework.
- Configured in the package.json file under the "scripts" section.
- Test script: "test": "cross-env NODE_ENV=test jest --detectOpenHandles".
- Sets the environment variable NODE_ENV to test.
- Executes Jest for running the tests, ensuring proper environment setup.

### Test Suite Coverage:

- Comprehensive coverage of various functionalities of the Todo application.
- Includes unit tests and integration tests.
- Unit tests implemented using Jest, covering individual components and functions.
- Integration tests performed using Supertest to test API endpoints.
- End-to-end tests conducted using Cypress to simulate user interactions.

### Automatic Test Suite Execution on GitHub:

- Configured to automatically execute the test suite upon pushing changes to GitHub using GitHub Actions.
- Workflow defined in .github/workflows/main.yml file.
- Triggered on push events.
- Sets up a PostgreSQL service container for running tests against a test database.
- Checks out the repository, installs dependencies, sets up the test database, and executes unit tests using Jest.
- Runs the application, sets up the environment, and executes integration tests using Cypress.

### GitHub Actions Walkthrough:

- Starts by defining the name of the workflow and specifying the triggers.
- Sets up a PostgreSQL service container for the test database.
- Checks out the repository code and installs dependencies using npm ci.
- Sets up the test database by running Sequelize commands to drop, create, and migrate the database schema.
- Runs unit tests using Jest.
- Installs Cypress and executes integration tests to validate the functionality of the application.

### Conclusion:

- Demonstrates a robust testing setup with Jest, Supertest, and Cypress.
- Automatic test suite execution on GitHub using GitHub Actions ensures continuous testing.
- Helps maintain code quality by detecting regressions early in the development process.
- Provides a comprehensive solution for ensuring the reliability and functionality of the Todo application.
